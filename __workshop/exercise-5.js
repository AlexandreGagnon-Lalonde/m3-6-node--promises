// Exercise 5 - `getDistanceFromIss`
// ---------------------------------
// Again here you should re-use two previously created functions, plus the `getDistance` function provided to you in `workshop.js`.
//
// One of the functions does address ==> position and the other simply does nothing ==> position.
// The `getDistance` function needs the two positions to compute the final value.


// Given an address (a string), returns the distance between that address and the ISS
// You'll need to use getDistance, getIssPosition and getAddressPosition
function getDistanceFromIss(address) {

}
