// Exercise 1 - `getIssPosition`
// -----------------------------

// require the 'request-promise' module.


// Returns the current position of the ISS
function getIssPosition() {

}

// NOTE:
in order to see the result of the promise, you need to console.log
the data WITHIN the promise chain (in its own then)

You are 'returning' the value, beacause you will need this functionality
in another exercise.

If you console.log the the function call, you will not see the result as console.log
doesn't wait for the promise to be resolved to execute.

// psst.... don't forget to call the function
